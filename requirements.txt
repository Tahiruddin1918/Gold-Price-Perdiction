pandas          # Data manipulation and analysis (reading/writing CSVs, data cleaning)
matplotlib      # Plotting graphs and visualizations
seaborn         # Statistical data visualization (histograms, boxplots, heatmaps)
sklearn         # Machine learning algorithms and model evaluation
joblib          # Model serialization (saving/loading models)
warnings        # Suppress warnings during execution
```

This file ensures that everyone working on the project uses the same library versions, ensuring reproducibility and consistency.
